# lcmtypes

These files were automatically generated by the lcm-gen tool based on type definitions used in [Drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/drake/lcmtypes) and manually imported into this directory.

They are not intended to be edited by hand.
Later on we will import them using the proper mechanisms in bazel.
