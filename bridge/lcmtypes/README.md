# lcmtypes

This files were automatically generated by the lcm-gen tool based on type definitions used in [Drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake), and imported by hand into this directory.

They are not intended to be edited by hand.
Later on we will import them using the proper mechanisms in bazel.
