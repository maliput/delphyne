# Python examples

These examples are intended to demonstrate how to use the python bindings of the
simulation runner.

For all the examples below it's assumed that the Delphyne backend was successfully
built with CMake, as shown in the instructions
[here](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/delphyne-gui/blob/master/README.md#build-delphyne-back-end) .
