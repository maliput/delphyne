# Python examples

These examples are intended to demonstrate how to use the python bindings of the simulation runner.

# keyboard_controlled_simulation.py
This example shows how to use the keyboard events to control the advance of a simulation.

In order to run this example, you must be placed in the
`<delphyne_ws>/install/bin` directory. Then, you can call:

```bash
./keyboard_controlled_simulation.py
```

 The supported keys for the demo are the following:

<`p`> will pause the simulation if unpaused and viceversa.

<`s`> if paused, will step the simulation on a single step.

<`q`> will stop the simulation and eventually, quit the demo.
